# Microcontroller Project Repository

## Overview

This repository contains various microcontroller projects implemented by Ecem IÅŸildar. Each project demonstrates different aspects of microcontroller programming and interfacing.

## Projects

1. **Controlling LED Brightness using PWM**: Example of using Pulse Width Modulation to adjust LED brightness.
2. **Finite State Machine Design**: Implementation of state machines for various applications.
3. **P and PI Type Controllers**: Control systems using Proportional (P) and Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers.
4. **LED Control Application**: Basic LED manipulation.
5. **Temperature Sensing and UART Communication**: Sensing temperature and sending data to a PC via UART.
6. **LED Speedometer**: Visualization of speed using LEDs.
7. **Sinusoidal Wave Visualization with LEDs**: Representing sinusoidal waves through LED patterns.
8. **External and Internal Interrupts**: Managing interrupts within a microcontroller.
9. **Heat Controller**: Controlling heat based on temperature inputs.
